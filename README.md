# Goofy Particle Field UI

My attempt at messing around with a basic particle field that I built. 

I'm using Express with Node for the backend. All client side code is vanilla JS and HTML5. No libraries were used.

Have fun playing with some particles! 

The application is essentially a boilerplate for express which means the main (original) code to look for on this project is inside of the /public folder.
