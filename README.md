# Goofy Particle Field UI

My attempt at messing around with a basic particle field that I built. 

I'm using Express with Node for the backend. All client side code is vanilla JS and HTML5. No libraries were used.

Have fun playing with some particles. p.s. it's not terribly performant on certain browsers but seems to do well on chrome. I'll work on fixing up the issue of performance a bit.
